  * technical
    * fix D3D11 errors

    * logging
      * have a list of different logs and make an interface for reading those logs
      * logs can create notifications if something bad happens
      * per frame log - reset it every frame :)
      * export to clipboard

    * global error state/error.h
      * move functions over to using jfg_error.h
      * add an error log (once logging is done)

    * abstract renderer
      * move to using adstracted renderer

    * cleanup renderer
      * merge all texture types (target/source) into a single abstract texture type
      * load shaders from text files at run time
        * should be able to start up if we only compile a subset of all shaders(???)
        * add texture targets for writing debug output which can be viewed at runtime

      * port shaders to cleaned up renderer (reverse order they are rendered in dbrl.cpp)
        * card_render
        * debug_draw_world
        * debug_line_draw

        * effects_32
        * boxy_bold

    * asset reloading at runtime
      * load asset through asset manager?
      * asset manager watches for changes that require that asset be reloaded?

    * cleanup
      * prelude.h/stdafx.h
      * draw -> render, folder for renderers

    * get stack traces from assertion failures!!!
    * asynchronous sound loading
    * deprecate use of Python scripts in build system

    * libraries
      * something for threading! (threads.h?)
      * libogg

    * memory allocation
      * create a "large chunk allocator" for the assets manager and start loading/caching
        files into this area (perhaps we want to eventually have a strategy of having an
        assets file which is loaded in compressed format which remains resident in memory
        if all compressed assets are small?)

    * physics system
      * debug/create unit tests

  * improve imgui
    * global context
    * debug imgui global context
    * member functions
  * hide mouse/use custom mouse cursor
  * hold tab to view entity health
  * transaction processing
    * only collapse "Entity_Damage" events after processing transactions
  * "rational" class?
* technical
    * memory functions/context
    * global context/global error message
    * global context
        * thread local global context
    * strings
  * debug draw transparency

* bugs
  * "release" mode compile
  * events not sent if mouse leaves window - need to turn off map dragging mode when re-entering the
    window
  * card renderer to do proper anti aliasing/alpha transparency (also mip mapping)
  * ending turn before card dealt animation finished

* decision
  * characters/items/tiles to be rendered pixel perfect (tile shader)
  * do mouse picking/outlining using this pixel perfect texture
  * effects/cards should use the fancier shader (sprite shader)

* sprite rendering (effects/cards)
  * tiles to be rendered with parameters:
    * horiz stretch
    * vertical stretch
    * rotation
    to be applied stretches first
  * correct pixel sampling (i.e. blend when a pixel overlaps edge of samples)
  * generate anisotropic mips (?)

* create a proper windows game loop
  * make jfg/input.h to convert input from windows to custom input format
    * read input from windows message loop and translate it to sensibly buffered input

* create xinput loading lib

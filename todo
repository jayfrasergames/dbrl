    * 6 schools of magic with 8 spells each (48 spells)
      * focus cards on melee/close range attacks to make sure positioning is actually relevant

    * level generation
      * classic 26 level dungeon
      * forking paths (e.g. level with two stairs down, one with spider webs, another with other environmental clues showing a different type of enemy)
      * different enemy groups have their own map styles
      * progression:
        * first levels caves

          * cavern/entrance to later levels
        * entrance to

      that summons more webs and more spiders :-D!)
  * doors
    * field of vision
    * trapped
    * locked
    * opens but gets stuck/doesn't close
    * opens but breaks
    * opens but becomes portal
  * deprecate "physics" in favour of simpler tile based logic for explosions/lightning etc (???)

  * refactor
    * anim
    * renderer unify texture types (source texture/target texture)
    * deprecate use of assets.bin for non-release candidates
      * load sounds from wave files at run time
      * deprecate gigabyte asset buffer *barf*

  * variable move duration depending on user input frequency
    * animation "speeding up" when moves made rapidly

* scenarios:
  * invisible wall (interrupt transaction pre-enter/rebound for movement)
    * test scenario: walk into invisible wall whilst standing on a drop tile
  * enemy abilities
    * some creature with an attack which "pulls" the player towards them (e.g. a frog with a tongue attack)
  * a spell which leaves an aura on a creature (e.g. particles which follow the creature etc)

  * technical
    * logging
      * have a list of different logs and make an interface for reading those logs
      * logs can create notifications if something bad happens
      * per frame log - reset it every frame :)
      * export to clipboard

    * global error state/error.h
      * move functions over to using jfg_error.h
      * add an error log (once logging is done)

    * cleanup renderer
      * merge all texture types (target/source) into a single abstract texture type
      * add texture targets for writing debug output which can be viewed at runtime

      * port shaders to cleaned up renderer (reverse order they are rendered in dbrl.cpp)
        * card_render

    * asset reloading at runtime
      * load asset through asset manager?
      * asset manager watches for changes that require that asset be reloaded?

    * cleanup
      * prelude.h/stdafx.h
      * draw -> render, folder for renderers

    * get stack traces from assertion failures!!!
    * asynchronous sound loading
    * deprecate use of Python scripts in build system

    * libraries
      * something for threading! (threads.h?)
      * libogg

    * memory allocation
      * create a "large chunk allocator" for the assets manager and start loading/caching
        files into this area (perhaps we want to eventually have a strategy of having an
        assets file which is loaded in compressed format which remains resident in memory
        if all compressed assets are small?)

    * physics system
      * debug/create unit tests

  * improve imgui
    * global context
    * debug imgui global context
    * member functions
  * hide mouse/use custom mouse cursor
  * hold tab to view entity health
  * transaction processing
    * only collapse "Entity_Damage" events after processing transactions
* technical
    * memory functions/context
    * global context/global error message
    * global context
        * thread local global context
    * strings
  * debug draw transparency

* bugs
  * "release" mode compile
  * events not sent if mouse leaves window - need to turn off map dragging mode when re-entering the
    window
  * card renderer to do proper anti aliasing/alpha transparency (also mip mapping)
  * ending turn before card dealt animation finished

* decision
  * characters/items/tiles to be rendered pixel perfect (tile shader)
  * do mouse picking/outlining using this pixel perfect texture
  * effects/cards should use the fancier shader (sprite shader)

* sprite rendering (effects/cards)
  * tiles to be rendered with parameters:
    * horiz stretch
    * vertical stretch
    * rotation
    to be applied stretches first
  * correct pixel sampling (i.e. blend when a pixel overlaps edge of samples)
  * generate anisotropic mips (?)

* create a proper windows game loop
  * make jfg/input.h to convert input from windows to custom input format
    * read input from windows message loop and translate it to sensibly buffered input

* create xinput loading lib
